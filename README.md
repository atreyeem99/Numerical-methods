# Numerical-methods
## Program and algorithm
- Set of algorithms along with statements for user interactions.
- Algorithms are predefined operations to convert input to output.
## Types of NM
1) Direct
   -fixed algorithms with fixed elementary steps.
   - Error is due to computer precision like rounding off

2) Itirative
   - Requires initial guess for the final solution.
   - Value is given as an input and then the algorithm would repeat until the input and output are equal.

3) Heuristic
   -Based on experience.
   -Does not guarantee a solution

## Fixed root iteration
-initial value x
-g(x)= {x + A/x}/2
 -where A is the number whose sq root we want to find
 -g(x) value becomes the next x
 -when x is equal to g(x), that g(x) is the square root
